I was a kid of the 90s, so I have a certain fondness for retro-y, pixel-y visuals. It was a golden age of video games like Doom, Commander Keen, etc. The only reference for this piece was the car at the forefront. There's got to be a place in Los Angeles that looks like this at some point in the day, right?
